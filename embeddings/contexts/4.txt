4. Intended use
The device is designed for applications operated with a
230 V alternating current source.
Be sure to observe the restrictions in the safety
instructions.
The generator is intended to provide electric power
tools and light sources with electricity. When using the
device with household appliances, please check their
suitability in accordance with the relevant manufacturerâ€™s instructions. 
In case of doubt, ask an authorized dealer of the respective equipment.
This generator is only intended for the operation of
electrical devices which maximum power lies within
the performance indications of the generator. A higher
inrush current of inductive consumers must be considered.
Inverter
The inverter generator generates electricity in a whole
new way. With a small, multipole winding in the inside
the produced voltage is converted via electronic first
into DC voltage afterwards into alternating voltage with
a clean sinus wave. With this clean sinus wave it is
possible to operate electrical devices without damaging them.
The machine is to be used only for its prescribed purpose. Any other use is deemed to be a case of misuse.
