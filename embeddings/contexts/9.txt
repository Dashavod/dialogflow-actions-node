9. Never touch the generator with wet hands.
10. Guard against electric danger.
11. When working outdoors, use only extension cables that are approved for outdoor use and which
are marked accordingly (H07RN).
12. The overall length of the extension cables used is
not allowed to exceed 1,5 mm2
 for 50 m and 2,5
mm2
 for 100 m.
13. Repairs and adjustment work may only be carried
out by authorized trained personnel.
14. Do not touch any mechanically driven or hot parts.
Do not remove the safety guards.
15. The values quoted in the technical data under
sound power level (LWA) and sound pressure level (LpA) are emission values and not necessarily
reliable workplace values. As there is a correlation between emission and immission levels, the
values cannot be taken to reliably determine the
possible need for additional precautions. Factors
influencing the current immission level of the user/
operator include the properties of the work area,
other sound sources etc., e.g. the number of machines and other neighboring processes, and the
time span over which the user/operator is subjected to the noise. Also, the permitted immission level
can vary from country to country.
